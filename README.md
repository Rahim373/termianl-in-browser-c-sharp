# Terminal in Browser (C# and React)
Executing commands from the browser seems interesting ðŸ˜‚ right? This project shows an example of how we can do that. To achieve that, this uses SignalR for real-time communication.

Note: This project is influenced by the [terminal-in-browser](https://github.com/foyzulkarim/terminal-in-browser) project from GitHub.
