## Technology Used
### Front-End:
* **Framework**: React is utilized as the primary framework for building the user interface, offering a dynamic and responsive web experience.
* **Libraries**:
  1. `terminal-in-react`: This npm library is incorporated to simulate a terminal within the React application, enabling command execution and display within the browser.
  1. `@microsoft/signalr`: Leveraged for establishing real-time web socket communication between the client and server, facilitating immediate response and interaction within the application.

### Back-End:
* **Platform**: .Net Core 6 serves as the foundation for the server-side application, providing robust and efficient handling of backend logic.
* **Communication**: SignalR is employed for its web socket communication capabilities, ensuring real-time data exchange and command execution feedback between the client and server.

This project underscores the potential of combining modern web technologies to create interactive and real-time web applications, emphasizing the utility of SignalR in achieving seamless client-server communication.
